                                            My name is Randy Patterson, and I’m currently looking for a job in youth services. 
                                            I have 10 years of experience working with youth agencies. I have a bachelor’s degree in outdoor education. I raise money, train leaders, and organize units. I have raised over $100,000 each of the last six years. 
                                            I consider myself a good public speaker, and I have a good sense of humor.
